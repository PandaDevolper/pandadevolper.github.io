          <h5>4 June 22</h5>
          
          <p>It is intresting how far you one can go down a rabbit hole. A rabbit hole of many sizes, in many forms. A wikipedia article, and yet you keep clicking on new links. This is one, that I myself often go down. When I discovered Github pages, I thought, hey I can host a website for free. And thus now I decided to test a blog. Will this continue. Probably not. If I do continue, enjoy. What will this be about?, everything, probably my thoughts, when I learn something new, my desire to share knowledge! My confusion, my happines and random knowledge. Why did I make a blog? Because I can, to show that time is money, so without money to pay for a premade blog, make a blog, typing in HTML from a text editor! I called it down the rabbit hole because I often get sucked into new information, and sucked into possiblities, and reasoning, leading me to a rabbit hole of randomness!</p>
